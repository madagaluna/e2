## Notes for instructor
Thank you for all your help over the semester.

I feel like this was the perfect way for me to learn.  The videos were great - I felt like you anticipated my questions.  Being able to work along side the videos, and go back and do things over, was a game changer for me.  I am still struggling, but I have moments where pieces of this come together.  The final class brought the lessons together so well!  I don't think I could repeat the steps on my own, but I have a much greater sense of what each file and folder is doing and sometimes I feel like I'm actually reading the code.  Ternary makes perfect sense!  

I am inclined to watch the videos over from the beginning - now that I know where it's heading, it may fall into place in my brain a little better.  We'll see.

I worked on the .css while waiting for a response to my testing question.  I would have entered quite a few **outside resources** for .css but none of the code worked;  Confetti,overriding bootstrap, a carousel for photos,etc. I also used outside resources to look up [MalformedLocatorException] but I didn't find anything helpful.

I hope I will not be penalized for my game being so similar to your example. I had no idea I'd have a step by step primer to put it all together - alas I ran into many problems, regardless.
