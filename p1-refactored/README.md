## Game planning

        Initialize an array to hold results
        Create an array of available performance times
        For Performer A, randomly choose a time to perform
        For Performer B, randomly choose a time to perform
        Update schedule to include Performer B if the time is available
        Announce that The Bars will not perform 
        Concatenate the schedule and make it a string 
        Show results

## Notes for instructor

Not exactly the game I intended to design but I learned a lot that I was not expecting to learn. Some technical, some just good ole workarounds!
