## Game planning

+ initialize an array called schedule
+ Create an array of times to perform
+ defining the performer variables
+ For Performer A, randomly choose a time to perform:
+ add performer A's time to the schedule    
+  For Performer B, randomly choose a time to perform:
+  compare performer B's time to performer A's time to see if time is available
+  updated schedule to include PB if the time is available and announce when both bands will perform        
+ announce that the second band will not perform 
+ print performance schedule

## Notes for instructor
*n/a ... but I am super excited to make a game called "Rock or Roll" to determine if a band can play based on how loud it is, what time they will to play and proximity to other bands and their loudness and performance time.  Ultimately I would like to incorporate longitudinal and latitudinal information but I will start with distance and see how this goes.  If this sounds too complicated for a complete novice, please let me know.*
