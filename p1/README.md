## Game planning

## Outside resources

## Notes for instructor
*n/a ... but I am super excited to make a game called "Rock or Roll" to determine if a band can play based on how loud it is, what time they will to play and proximity to other bands and their loudness and performance time.  Ultimately I would like to incorporate longitudinal and latitudinal information but I will start with distance and see how this goes.  If this sounds too complicated for a complete novice, please let me know.*
